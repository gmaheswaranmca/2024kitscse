Selectors
    As elements are added to a web page, 
    they may be styled using CSS. 
    A selector designates exactly 
    which element or elements within our HTML 
    to target and apply styles 
    (such as color, size, and position) to. 
    ---
    Selectors generally target an attribute value, 
    such as an "id" or "class" value, or 
    target the "type of element", 
    such as <h1> or <p>
    ---
    Example:
    p { ... }

    Here, styles are applied for element "p" ie paragraph 

Properties [name:value;]
    Once an element is selected, 
    a property determines the styles 
    that will be applied to that element.

    Some are
    background, color, font-size, height, and width
    p {
    color: orange;
    font-size: 16px;
    }

    Here,
    "p" is the selector 
    "color", "font-size" are the properties 
    "orange" is value for "color" property 
    "16px" is the value for "font-size" property
